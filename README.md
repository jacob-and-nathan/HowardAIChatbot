This is an AI robot I made, that uses AI to ask questions, then uses it's vocabulary and previous questions it has asked to answer your questions. You need to download and run the main.py file AND you need to download the data.txt file and put it in the same folder as the main.py file.
This was made in the python 3 programming language. You need to download python 3 to run this. To do that, go here:

Remember, you need to download Python 3!
